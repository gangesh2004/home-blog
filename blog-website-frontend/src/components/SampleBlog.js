    "author": "Anant",
    "content": "<h3>The Beginning</h3><p>In 2019, like many others, I embarked on my JEE journey with lots of hope and inspiration. I had just cleared my 10th grade with an impressive CGPA, narrowly missing the top spot in my school to Anshika Maurya—a fierce and inspiring girl who I hope has become a doctor by now. I started brilliantly, ranking among the toppers and working hard. However, as time went on, I faced several challenges.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Struggles</h3><p>Being away from home, I found it difficult to ask my teachers for help due to fear. The people around me were not very motivating, and I struggled to find the inspiration within myself. By the end of 11th grade, I realized I had to do something to get back on track. I began picking up the missing pieces, finding the best online tutorials available. Resources like Physics Wallah, Motion, Allen, Resonance, NTA official materials, and Arihant books became my go-to study aids. Slowly, my concepts became clearer, and I started motivating myself.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Road to Improvement</h3><p>JEE is a vast subject, and despite my efforts, I was never able to completely finish the syllabus. The absence of consistent practice meant I knew I was falling short of my goal to secure a top 100 rank in the IITs—a dream I still miss. There were times when I thought of giving up, as the pressure felt overwhelming. I lashed out at my family and friends, feeling scared and lost. Thankfully, my brother, parents, and friends kept motivating me, and I managed to clear JEE with my reservation, though this fact still stings a bit.</p><p><br></p><h3>College Life and Beyond</h3><p>Once I got into college, I was not entirely happy but felt a sense of satisfaction. To prove my worth at IIT, I worked hard and successfully changed my branch from Electrical Engineering to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) at IIT Bhilai. This transition happened during the virtual learning period of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many were resorting to cheating. However, I stayed true to my principles and worked diligently.</p><p><br></p><h3>Gratitude and Reflection</h3><p>I cannot miss the opportunity to thank God, as He has always been there for me. This journey has taught me the importance of perseverance, self-belief, and the support of loved ones. So, keep believing—there may be delays, but there is no darkness.</p><p><br></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>My journey to JEE Advanced was filled with ups and downs, moments of self-doubt, and the struggle to find motivation. However, it also taught me valuable lessons in resilience and determination. Despite the challenges, I am proud of what I have achieved and continue to strive for excellence in my field. Remember, no matter how tough the journey may seem, with perseverance and support, you can overcome any obstacle.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "title": "Cricket in My Life",
    "author": "Anant",
    "content": "<h2><br></h2><h3>Early Memories</h3><p>I started knowing about cricket in 2011 when I was seven years old. I vividly remember my father and his ten friends crowding our room to watch cricket. The room was completely filled, with people even peeking through the window to catch a glimpse of the TV. I was a kid and not very interested in the game back then, but I recall how everyone was critical of Dhoni's slow start when he came to bat. Despite that, they believed in his ability to turn the game around. Those were unbelievable scenes, and I doubt if they can ever be repeated. That's how cricket entered my life.</p><p><br></p><h3>Childhood Play</h3><p>I used to play cricket at home with my elder brothers using plastic balls. We, along with my friends, played all day long. Cricket was a major part of my childhood. However, when I reached class 9th, I was told I had grown up and needed to focus on my studies. Although I had always been a decent student, this was a turning point where I started taking my studies more seriously, making cricket a second priority.</p><p><br></p><h3>Balancing Cricket and Studies</h3><p>In class 10th and later during my JEE preparation and college years, cricket took a backseat to my academic responsibilities. However, when I joined IIT Bhilai, I decided to give cricket another shot. I worked hard in my first and second years and got the opportunity to participate in the inter-IIT cricket tournament for two consecutive years. Though I only got a chance to play in my third year and performed poorly, it was a learning experience. My focus had shifted more towards studies, but my love for cricket never waned.</p><p><br></p><h3>Current Passion</h3><p>Currently, Rishabh Pant is my favorite Indian player. I love watching cricket and predicting the best moves during matches. Most of the time, my predictions are accurate. Cricket remains an integral part of my life, and I continue to enjoy and cherish the sport.</p><p><br></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Cricket has been a constant in my life, from childhood memories with my family and friends to balancing it with my academic pursuits. It has taught me lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and the importance of balancing passions with responsibilities. I will always love cricket, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.</p><p><br></p>",
